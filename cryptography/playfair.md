Playfair Cipher Technique

The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher, where pairs of letters are encrypted together instead of individual letters. It was invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854 and later popularized by Lord Playfair. It uses a 5x5 matrix of letters, where the key word or phrase is placed in the matrix, and the remaining letters of the alphabet are filled in.
Steps for Encryption Using the Playfair Cipher:

    Prepare the Key Table:
        Choose a keyword (e.g., "GALOIS").
        Remove duplicate letters from the keyword.
        Complete the 5x5 matrix with the remaining letters of the alphabet (except 'J', which is combined with 'I').

    Key Table for 'GALOIS':

    G A L O I
    S B C D E
    F H J K M
    N P Q R T
    U V W X Y

    Prepare the Plaintext:
        Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of two letters). If a pair contains duplicate letters (like "LL"), insert an 'X' between them.
        If the plaintext has an odd number of letters, add 'X' at the end.

    Plaintext: "COMSEC means communications security"
        Split the plaintext: CO MS EC ME AN SX EC SE CU RI TY

    (Added 'X' between duplicate characters and at the end.)

    Encryption Rules:
        For each pair of letters, locate them in the 5x5 matrix.
        If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters immediately to their right (wrap around to the start of the row if necessary).
        If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below (wrap around to the top of the column if necessary).
        If the letters are in different rows and columns, replace them with the letters that are in the same row but the column of the other letter.

Playfair Cipher Encryption for 'COMSEC means communications security'
Step 1: Prepare the Key Table

Using the keyword "GALOIS", we create the following 5x5 matrix (with 'J' omitted and combined with 'I'):

G A L O I
S B C D E
F H I K M
N P Q R T
U V W X Y

Step 2: Prepare the Plaintext

The plaintext "COMSEC means communications security" becomes:

Plaintext:

CO MS EC ME AN SX EC SE CU RI TY

Step 3: Encrypt the Digraphs Using the Key Table

    CO: C is at (2, 3), O is at (1, 4) → Replace with LO
    MS: M is at (3, 5), S is at (2, 1) → Replace with FS
    EC: E is at (2, 5), C is at (2, 3) → Replace with DB
    ME: M is at (3, 5), E is at (2, 5) → Replace with MF
    AN: A is at (1, 2), N is at (4, 1) → Replace with GN
    SX: S is at (2, 1), X is at (5, 4) → Replace with UV
    EC: E is at (2, 5), C is at (2, 3) → Replace with DB
    SE: S is at (2, 1), E is at (2, 5) → Replace with AD
    CU: C is at (2, 3), U is at (5, 1) → Replace with FY
    RI: R is at (4, 4), I is at (3, 5) → Replace with KT
    TY: T is at (4, 5), Y is at (5, 5) → Replace with XY

Final Ciphertext:

LO FS DB MF GN UV DB AD FY KT XY

Thus, the encrypted message using the Playfair Cipher with the key "GALOIS" is:

LO FS DB MF GN UV DB AD FY KT XY

Summary of the Playfair Cipher Process:

    Key Table Creation: A 5x5 matrix is created using the keyword and the remaining letters of the alphabet.
    Plaintext Preparation: The plaintext is split into digraphs (pairs of letters), with 'X' added to handle duplicate letters and odd-length plaintexts.
    Encryption: The digraphs are encrypted based on their positions in the key table, using specific rules depending on their locations in the matrix.

The Playfair Cipher provides a simple yet effective way to encrypt text, though it is not as secure as modern ciphers like AES due to its relatively small key space.
