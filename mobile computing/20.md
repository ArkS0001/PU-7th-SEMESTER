a) Define the term Mobile IP.

Mobile IP is a protocol that allows mobile devices to move between different networks while maintaining a permanent IP address. It enables seamless communication by forwarding data packets to the mobile device's current location using a home agent (HA) and foreign agent (FA).
b) Describe the concept of frequency reuse in cellular communication.

Frequency reuse is a technique used in cellular networks to maximize the use of available spectrum. The service area is divided into smaller regions called cells, each with its own set of frequencies. Adjacent cells use different frequencies to avoid interference, but non-adjacent cells can reuse the same frequencies, increasing the network's capacity.
c) Describe the handover/handoffs in cellular communications.

Handoff refers to the process of transferring an ongoing call or data session from one cell or channel to another without interruption. Types of handoffs include:

    Hard Handoff: A "break-before-make" approach where the connection is dropped before a new one is established.
    Soft Handoff: A "make-before-break" approach where the connection is maintained until a new one is established.
    Vertical Handoff: Occurs between different types of networks (e.g., cellular to Wi-Fi).
    Horizontal Handoff: Occurs within the same type of network.

d) Describe the use of Care-of-Address (CoA) in Mobile IP.

The Care-of-Address (CoA) is a temporary IP address assigned to a mobile device when it is connected to a foreign network. The CoA allows the home agent to forward packets to the device's current location. Types of CoA include:

    Foreign Agent CoA: Obtained from the foreign agent.
    Co-located CoA: Assigned directly to the mobile device.

e) Describe fault tolerance for mobile agent computing.

Fault tolerance in mobile agent computing ensures system reliability despite failures. Techniques include:

    Replication: Duplicating mobile agents to continue operations if one fails.
    Checkpointing: Saving the agent's state periodically to enable recovery.
    Redundancy: Using backup agents or nodes to ensure seamless operation.

f) Explain the concept of disconnected operation with reference to file management in agent-based computing.

Disconnected operation allows mobile devices to continue accessing and modifying files even without network connectivity. Mechanisms include:

    Caching: Storing frequently accessed files locally.
    Prefetching: Predicting and downloading files in advance based on user behavior.
    Conflict Resolution: Synchronizing changes made during disconnection once the device reconnects.

g) Examine the reasoning behind choosing a hexagonal shape for cells in cellular systems.

Hexagonal cells are chosen because they:

    Provide maximum area coverage with minimal overlapping.
    Simplify frequency reuse by equally distributing coverage without gaps.
    Offer a better approximation of circular coverage compared to squares or triangles, minimizing signal loss at the edges.

h) Differentiate between proactive and reactive types of Ad-hoc routing protocols.

    Proactive Protocols: Maintain updated routing information to all nodes by periodically exchanging control messages (e.g., DSDV, OLSR).
        Advantages: Quick route establishment.
        Disadvantages: High overhead in dynamic networks.
    Reactive Protocols: Create routes only when needed (e.g., AODV, DSR).
        Advantages: Efficient in dynamic networks.
        Disadvantages: Higher latency during route discovery.

i) Explain hidden and exposed node problems in wireless LAN.

    Hidden Node Problem: Occurs when two nodes cannot detect each other due to physical obstacles, leading to data collisions.
    Exposed Node Problem: Happens when a node refrains from transmitting because it senses another nearby node transmitting, even though the transmissions would not interfere.

j) List the four control packets used by TORA.

The Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) uses the following control packets:

    QRY (Query): Sent to request route information.
    UPD (Update): Used to propagate routing information.
    CLR (Clear): Clears invalid routes.
    HELLO: Maintains connectivity between nodes.

Mobile computing is a technology that enables users to access information and perform computing tasks anytime and anywhere using portable devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, or wearables. It leverages wireless communication networks and protocols for seamless connectivity.
b) Describe the concept of frequency reuse in cellular communication.

Frequency reuse is a method used in cellular communication to optimize the utilization of limited frequency spectrum. The service area is divided into small regions called cells, and each cell is assigned a unique set of frequencies. Adjacent cells use different frequencies to avoid interference, but non-adjacent cells can reuse the same frequencies, enhancing network capacity and coverage.

d) Describe the use of Care-of-Address (CoA) in Mobile IP.

The Care-of-Address (CoA) is a temporary IP address assigned to a mobile device when it connects to a foreign network. It allows the mobile device to maintain uninterrupted communication while roaming. The home agent forwards packets to the CoA, ensuring the mobile device can receive data irrespective of its location.
e) Illustrate the use of prefetching and caching in mobile data management.

    Prefetching: Anticipates user needs by downloading data in advance based on user behavior patterns. For example, a video streaming app preloads the next video segment while the current one is being watched.
    Caching: Temporarily stores frequently accessed data locally to reduce latency and improve performance. For example, web browsers cache website data to speed up subsequent visits.

f) Explain the concept of disconnected operation with reference to file management in agent-based computing.

Disconnected operation allows users to continue accessing and modifying files even without network connectivity. Key mechanisms:

    Local Caching: Stores frequently used files locally on the device.
    Synchronization: Updates changes to the central server once connectivity is restored.
    Conflict Resolution: Handles discrepancies between local and server files to maintain consistency.

g) Describe fault tolerance for mobile agent computing.

Fault tolerance ensures mobile agent computing systems remain operational despite failures. Techniques include:

    Replication: Creates multiple copies of agents to mitigate the risk of failure.

        Discovers routes on demand using RREQ (Route Request) and RREP (Route Reply) messages.
        Maintains only active routes, reducing overhead.

    DSR (Dynamic Source Routing Protocol):
        Uses source routing, where the entire route to the destination is included in the packet header.
        Nodes store discovered routes in a route cache for future use.
