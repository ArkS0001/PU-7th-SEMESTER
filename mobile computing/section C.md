a) ii) Hidden and Exposed Node Problems in WLAN

Wireless LANs (WLANs) face unique challenges due to the shared medium of communication.
Hidden Node Problem

Occurs when two devices cannot detect each otherâ€™s transmissions due to physical obstructions or distance, but both are within range of an access point (AP).

    Impact: Leads to data collisions, reduced throughput, and inefficiency.
    Example: Devices A and C are hidden from each other but connected to AP B.

Exposed Node Problem

Occurs when a node unnecessarily refrains from transmission, fearing interference with nearby ongoing transmissions, even though it is not required.

    Impact: Reduces network utilization and bandwidth efficiency.
    Example: Device B avoids transmitting data to C, assuming it might interfere with A's transmission to D.

Solution Using MACA (Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)

    Request to Send (RTS):
        Sender sends an RTS packet to the receiver, notifying its intent to transmit data.
    Clear to Send (CTS):
        Receiver sends a CTS packet if it is ready, alerting neighbors to stay silent.
    Data Transmission:
        Sender transmits the data after receiving CTS.

Advantages:

    Prevents collisions in hidden node scenarios.
    Optimizes network bandwidth usage.

b) i) Modes and Components of WLAN

Wireless LANs (WLANs) operate in two modes:
Modes of WLAN Operation

        Devices communicate through an access point (AP), which acts as a central hub.
        Used in corporate offices and public hotspots.
        Advantages: Wide coverage, centralized control, and high scalability.

    Ad-Hoc Mode:
        Devices communicate directly without an AP.
        Used in peer-to-peer file sharing or small group communications.
        Advantages: No dependency on additional hardware, cost-effective.

Components of WLAN

    Access Points (APs):
        Act as bridges between wired and wireless networks.
        Manage connections and allocate bandwidth.

    Wireless Stations:
        Devices like laptops, smartphones, or tablets equipped with wireless adapters.

d) i) Basic Elements of a Mobile IP System

Mobile IP is designed to support the mobility of devices across different networks while maintaining a stable IP address. The architecture consists of three key elements:

    Mobile Node (MN):
        A device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) that moves across networks.
        Retains its original IP address regardless of location.

    Home Agent (HA):
        Resides in the mobile nodeâ€™s home network.
        Tracks the current location of the MN and forwards data to its Care-of-Address (CoA).

    Foreign Agent (FA):
        Resides in the visited network.
        Assigns a Care-of-Address (CoA) to the MN and facilitates communication with the HA.

    Correspondent Node (CN):
        The device communicating with the MN.

Process of Mobile IP Communication

    Registration:
        MN informs HA of its current CoA via the FA.
    Tunneling:
        HA encapsulates and forwards data to the MN via the FA.
    Decapsulation:
        FA decapsulates data and delivers it to the MN.

Advantages:

    Seamless connectivity, support for mobility, and transparency to end-users.

d) ii) Advantages of Agent-Based Computing and Fault-Tolerant Mobile Agents
Advantages of Agent-Based Computing

    Autonomy:
        Agents operate independently without continuous supervision.

    Mobility:

        Suitable for distributed systems with dynamic workloads.

    Fault Tolerance:
        Agents adapt to failures and recover tasks without losing data.

Characteristics of Fault-Tolerant Mobile Agents

    Persistence:
        Agents use checkpoints to save their state and resume after a failure.

    Replication:
        Multiple instances of an agent operate concurrently to ensure task completion.

    Error Handling:
        Agents can detect, recover, and retry operations in case of errors.

e) i) DSDV Routing with Example

Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) is a proactive routing protocol for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). It maintains consistent routing tables at all nodes.
Example Demonstrating Topology Update

    Initial Network:
        Nodes A, B, and C form a simple topology.
        Routing Table at Node A:
        Destination	Next Hop	Metric	Sequence Number
        B	B	1	2
        C	B	2	2

    Topology Change:
        A new link between A and C reduces the hop count.

    Routing Table Update:
        Node A updates its routing table:
        Destination	Next Hop	Metric	Sequence Number
        C	C	1	3

Advantages:

    Consistent routes, quick updates, and low latency for known destinations.

e) ii) Reactive Routing in GSR
Message Types in Reactive Routing

    Route Request (RREQ):
        Broadcast by the source to discover a route to the destination.

    Route Reply (RREP):
        Sent by the destination or an intermediate node with a valid route.

    Route Error (RERR):
        Informs nodes of broken links.

Route Discovery Mechanism in GSR (Global State Routing)

    Initiation:
        Source node broadcasts a RREQ.

    Propagation:
        Intermediate nodes forward the RREQ while recording the previous hop.

    Response:
        Destination node sends a RREP along the reverse path.

    Maintenance:
        Nodes monitor link status and send RERR if a link breaks.

Advantages:

    Reduces overhead for dynamic topologies.
