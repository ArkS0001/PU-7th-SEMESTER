b) McClelland's Achievement Motivation Theory in Detail

McClellandâ€™s Achievement Motivation Theory states that human behavior is influenced by three primary needs:

    Need for Achievement (nAch):

        Individuals with high nAch set challenging but attainable goals and seek feedback on their performance.

    Need for Affiliation (nAff):
        Desire for interpersonal relationships and a sense of belonging.
        People with high nAff prioritize collaboration and harmony in group settings.

    Need for Power (nPow):
        The desire to influence or control others.
        Individuals with high nPow may strive for leadership roles and decision-making authority.

Entrepreneurs are typically driven by a high nAch, where they seek personal fulfillment, continuous improvement, and accomplishment of challenging goals.
